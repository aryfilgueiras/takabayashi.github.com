## Projects

### Dr. Opinion

### Laguro.com

### YelpSpy

### Apache Marvin AI Platform

Marvin is an open source project that focuses on empowering data science teams to deliver complex solutions supported by a high-scale, low-latency, language agnostic and standardized architecture platform, while simplifying the process of exploration and modeling.

### Booska
Site to search for products on the web.

*Role*: **Architect, technical leader and developer**

Innovative project because it compares the price of other seekers (Eg. Buscapé and zoom) as well as being independent agreements with e-commerce, because all information is obtained from the web, from spiders programmed for this. The biggest challenge was to structure all the information obtained from the web.

The project is still in development but the first beta version was already available online.

*keywords*: **natural language processing, computer vision, play framework, cassandra, python, javascript, java, high availability, python, elastic search**

### Scanboo
Platform for crawler, structuring and match (visual and textual) of products.

*Role*: **Researcher, architect, technical leader and developer**

First SaS platform in Latin America that allows the uptake of e-commerces data over the Internet to preprocessing and classification, aimed at monitoring of price positions and deduplication products on a scale from semi-autonomously. This project has given rise to two: Boomage and Booska.
After nearly one year of scientific research, the biggest challenge was to overcome the scale in various fields (eg. Image processing, natural language processing, visual configuration of intelligent crawlers) with time constraints, besides the difficulty of gathering the skills needed to form the ideal team to make the product.
In this project, several different architectures have been proven, many of the results caused frustration in the team, but at the end of 6-month project and a team of nearly 20 people (researchers, data scientists and programmers) the second beta version of the platform launched .

### Boomage
Technology to recognise products from real photos.

*Role*: **Researcher, architect, technical leader and developer**

Innovative project that uses deep learning applied to computer vision to make it possible to search visually similar products on the basis of e-commerces.
The product was engineered and the first stable version released and sold in less than 4 months. The biggest challenge was working with machine learning in scale (millions of classified and indexed images) to meet an online application (5s response time).

### Julia Architect
Intelligent system for recommendation of architectural solutions

*Role*: **Researcher and developer**

Julia Architect is a tool that, using AI techniques, is designed to assist software architects in architectural design decisions, reusing past solutions for today's problems. Receives as input
non-functional requirements and returns suggestions of architectural solutions.

*Keywords*: **Case-based reasoning; Architectural tactics; Non-functional requirements; Quality attributes; Reuse of architectural decisions.**

### Oikos Hub Platform
Platform for distributing digital books (epub, pdf) comprises a DRM ecosystem (encrypted content distributor and mobile client for reading).

*Role*: **Researcher, architect, technical leader and developer**

Innovative project because it is an economical alternative to Apple and Adobe content distribution systems. The main objective was to provide small publishers the distribution of secure content in an economically viable way.

The beta version was created in just six months with a team of developers micromanagement. The challenge was to launch the beta in production with a minimum group of technicians without the proper knowledge in record time. The project was a success but was canceled for financial problems.

*keywords*: **liferay, ios, android, phonegap, encryption, drm, java, javascript, objective-c, aws.**

## Publications

### [Marvin - From exploratory models to production](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvin-ai/marvin-paper/master/from-exploratory-models-to-productions/marvin_paper.pdf)
*October 2017* **Papis.io**

Marvin is an open source project that focuses on empowering data science teams to deliver complex solutions supported by a high-scale, low-latency, language agnostic and standardized architecture platform, while simplifying the process of exploration and modeling. Build model-dependent applications in a robust way is not trivial, one is required to have knowledge in advanced areas of sciences like computing, statistics and math. Marvin aims to abstract the complexities in the creation process of a scalable, high available, interoperable and maintainable software.

### [BooViews: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews combining SVM and CRF in Portuguese](http://propor2016.di.fc.ul.pt/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GuilhermeNobrePROPORSRW2016.pdf)
*July 2016* **PROPOR – International Conference on the Computational Processing of Portuguese**

Customers use product reviews to gather opinion regarding a product before making a purchase decision. Reviews are available in several e-commerce businesses and wrote by real customers. Companies can use these reviews to harness consumer information by artificial intelligence algorithms and automatically extract product information, such as review polarity and product aspects. In this paper, we cover techniques to classify reviews polarity, extract product aspects and classify them. The resulting SVM classifier got 91.7% of precision in classifying the sentiment of the reviews, 74.2% of F1-score using CRF to extract the product aspects and 79.9% of precision classifying aspect’s polarity.

### [Preprocessing Images to Improve Deep Neural Networks Classification](http://propor2016.di.fc.ul.pt/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GuilhermeNobrePROPORSRW2016.pdf)
*October 2015* | **Proceedings of XI Workshop de Visão Computacional**

The amount of images used to train a classifier has a great impact in the algorithm’s performance. In the domain of e-commerce, most of the data set is formed by studio images and we demonstrate in this work that by multiplying the amount of images with different transformations can provide a significant boost on the overall performance of the classifier. Moreover, we list the challenges encountered in such task and present the improvements obtained with a classifier trained with additional images that were synthetically generated by applying several transformations on the original data set. Finally, we show that a Convolutional Neural Network, one of the current prominent algorithms in Computer Vision can be pooled together with binary classifiers for each class of images in order to predict images classes with great accuracy.
